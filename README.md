# Readme

The purpose of this repository is to store transformed data that will be used for insight generation. We saved the details of the process in 'data_transformation.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook.

## Data 
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) provides a wide range of statistical data on Australia's economic, population, environmental, and social issues. The report “National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (SMHWB)” was designed to provide information about mental disorders in Australia in 2007.  It collected information on three major mental disorders (Anxiety disorders, Affective disorders, and Substance Use disorders) with two different periods of mental disorders(12-month and lifetime). 

We transformed this ABS data to an easy-to-process format and saved it to a new CSV file called “transformed_data.csv” in this repository.
